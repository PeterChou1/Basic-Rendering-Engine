# This Repository is course work for the Computer Graphics course. It is separate to 4 folders representing each assignment


# Assignment 1
Assignment 1 had us implementing a basic 2d rendering to get to understand how 2d light transport works.
Features:
- 2d Light rendering 
- Basic Sphere/Line Intersection
- Refractions

# Assignment 2
Assignment 2 had us implementing a basic 3d ray tracer using simple ray casting.
Features:
- 3d Ray tracing
- ray/Sphere/Cylinder/Square Intersection
- Phong illumination
- Shadows
- Reflections

# Assignment 3
Assignment 3 had us extend on the raytracer we built in Assignment 2
Features:
- Anti Aliasing
- Texture Maps
- Area Light Sources
- Refractive Objects
- Ray Marching
- Normal Mapping

# Assignment 4
Assignment 4 In this assigment we implemented a path tracer to generated phto realistic images
Features:
- Path tracer
- Reflection Refraction
- Importance Sampling
- Explicit Light Sampling
